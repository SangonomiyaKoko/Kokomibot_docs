### Step 1: Link your wows account

1. First you need to know region and game ID.
2. Link your game account with the command `/link [Region] [GameID]`.
    - List of regions: asia, na, eu, ru, cn

> Example: /link asia SangonomiyaKokomi_


### Step 2: Modify Account Settings

1. Send the command `/bind` to view the default Settings for the current account.
2. Language: If you want to switch to another language, you can send `/set lang [Language]` to switch. **Please note that the commands are different in different languages**
    - List of Language: en, cn
3. PR Scale: If you don't like to see the PR score when you query the data, you can send `/set pr [off/on]` to turn it off or on. You can also click [here](https://asia.wows-numbers.com/personal/rating) for more information about PR score.
4. Recent/Recents: **These two functions are not enabled by default when you link an new account**. If not enabled, you can send the command `wws [recent/recents] on` to enable Recent or Recents.

> If you don't know what these two functions do, they will be introduced at the bottom of the article

#### Tips: What are the Recent and Recents functions?
Recent: 
1. Keep one copy of user data per day according to the date. 
2. This allows you to calculate battle statistics over a period of time, such as random battles or rank battles in the last week. 
3. Data can be retained for a longer period of time.

Recents: 
1. Unlike Recent, Recents only keeps data for every battle in the past day. 
2. The data retained is less, but more detailed.
